                <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been
                    the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley
                    of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries,
                    but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.</p>

                <p>It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum
                    passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including
                    versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
